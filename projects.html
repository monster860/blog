      This puzzle game was the winner of the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/um-flint-game-jam-11/results">11th UM-Flint Game Jam</a> in April 2022 and involves a thread mechanic where you are anchored to a string that can get caught on other objects. I did the art, the physics, and the music/sfx myself.

      This puzzle game was the winner of the werewolf game jam at UM-Flint in January 2021, which won the game jam and uses light-based mechanics. I did the art and the physics myself.
